title: Create your own developer blog from scratch with Next.js
description: Step-by-step walkthrough of how I created a smiple static blog with React, Next.js, Tailwind.css and Contentlayer

## Used technologies and libraries

- React and Next.js
- Contentlayer
- Tailwind.css

## MVP functionality

I started off with many ideas of what I'd like to see in my blog. As in any real life project, eventually I decided to not overcomplicate things and start with the minimum functionality:

- Home page with some basic info about me, including a small widget about my career and social link
- Post page with markdown content and comments based on GitHub profile

## Codes

We can write some `inline code`!

```js:sample.js showLineNumbers
const a = 1;
a = 2;
```

```tsx:App.tsx showLineNumbers {5,15-17}
import "@/styles/globals.css";

import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Head from "next/head";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

import LayoutWrapper from "@/components/LayoutWrapper";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="viewport-fit=cover" />
      </Head>
      <LayoutWrapper>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </LayoutWrapper>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
