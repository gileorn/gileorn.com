## Motivation for creating a personal blog

## Used technologies and libraries

- React and Next.js
- Contentlayer
- Tailwind.css

## MVP functionality

I started off with many ideas of what I'd like to see in my blog. As in any real life project, eventually I decided to not overcomplicate things and start with the minimum functionality:

- Home page with some basic info about me, including a small widget about my career and social link
- Post page with markdown content and comments based on GitHub profile

It’s not a surprise that many tech companies nowadays are experiencing a lot of challenges with the current economic uncertainty. Many startups shut down, and people get laid off, even at big tech companies. These are rough times for the industry. But as in many crises, we will get out of this even stronger and more resilient.

### Third paragraph

While we’re still in the middle of the storm, it is essential to receive the support needed for all of us. It’s great to be a part of a company that cares about its employees and proves it not just by words but by actions. But companies themselves are experiencing hard times. Shouldn’t this support be mutual? I’m not talking about working more hours or being paid less money. I just got interested in the whole idea that the current situation is a good trigger to ask myself:

## Codes

We can write some `inline code`!

```js:sample.js showLineNumbers
const a = 1;
a = 2;
```

```tsx:App.tsx showLineNumbers {5,15-17}
import "@/styles/globals.css";

import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Head from "next/head";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

import LayoutWrapper from "@/components/LayoutWrapper";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="viewport-fit=cover" />
      </Head>
      <LayoutWrapper>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </LayoutWrapper>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
