## Used technologies and libraries

- React and Next.js
- Contentlayer
- Tailwind.css

## MVP functionality

I started off with many ideas of what I'd like to see in my blog. As in any real life project, eventually I decided to not overcomplicate things and start with the minimum functionality:

- Home page with some basic info about me, including a small widget about my career and social link
- Post page with markdown content and comments based on GitHub profile
