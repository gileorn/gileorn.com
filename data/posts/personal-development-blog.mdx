## Motivation

- I'm at this point of my career where I have so many interesting ideas I want to explore and cool stuff I want to share that it was only a question of time when do I
- I gathered a critical mass of things I want to share with the world, both techincal and non-technical stuff. I just needed a way to do that that I'd like.

Ok, so I need a place/service, what are the options nowadays? Twitter? It is hardly a place to share some technical stuff anymore; It's more toxic and click-baiting than ever, thanks - not for me. Medium/Dev.to and all that other similar services? I don't want to give the control of my content to any third party that can in one day decide to put a paywall. The only option to build my own blog from the scratch.

## Used technologies and libraries

### React and Next.js

... wanted to check out wtf is next

### Contentlayer

Simplifies the usage of mdx files as posts

- React and Next.js as a foundation
- Contentlayer for using mdx files as posts
- Tailwind.css for styling
- Next.UI as a UI library
- Giscuss for comment section with Github discussions under the hood
- AWS Route 53 and Amplify for domain registration and deploy
- Supabase and PostgreSQL as a database of choice for likes and views counters
- Prism.js for code syntax highlighting
- Plausible as a SaaS of choice for analytics
- Hihlight.io as a SaaS of choice for error tracking

## MVP

- Visually attractive, minimalistic UI with responsivness, adapted for mobile phones
- Small about section with social links
- Statically generated posts that are stored as MDX files custom Notion-like layout
- Posts that are statically generated posts from MDX files with a result of Notion-like layout
- Dynamic table of contents for each post
- Comment section
- Code snipets with syntax highlighting
- Dark mode
- Likes and views counters
- Easy deploy, minimal maintenance
- Analytics with SaaS intergration
- Error tracking with SaaS intrgration

Things I left for later:

- Appearances page
- Bookmars page with books, articles and talks recommendations
- Posts page with tags, filtering and pagination
- Career section: CV, job history, projects and other stuff
- Native comments section

## MVP functionality

I started off with many ideas of what I'd like to see in my blog. As in any real life project, eventually I decided to not overcomplicate things and start with the minimum functionality:

- Home page with some basic info about me, including a small widget about my career and social link
- Post page with markdown content and comments based on GitHub profile

It’s not a surprise that many tech companies nowadays are experiencing a lot of challenges with the current economic uncertainty. Many startups shut down, and people get laid off, even at big tech companies. These are rough times for the industry. But as in many crises, we will get out of this even stronger and more resilient.

### Third paragraph

While we’re still in the middle of the storm, it is essential to receive the support needed for all of us. It’s great to be a part of a company that cares about its employees and proves it not just by words but by actions. But companies themselves are experiencing hard times. Shouldn’t this support be mutual? I’m not talking about working more hours or being paid less money. I just got interested in the whole idea that the current situation is a good trigger to ask myself:

## Codes

We can write some `inline code`!

```js:sample.js showLineNumbers
const a = 1;
a = 2;
```

```tsx:App.tsx showLineNumbers {5,15-17}
import "@/styles/globals.css";

import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Head from "next/head";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

import LayoutWrapper from "@/components/LayoutWrapper";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="viewport-fit=cover" />
      </Head>
      <LayoutWrapper>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </LayoutWrapper>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
