# The ergonomics of programming

Just think of how much time has passed since then and how drastically our world has changed. Standard keyboard with QWERTY layout is a truly ancient thing. We use it now only because at some point in the past people decided that it is good enough and that to challenge this standart is to waste valuable resoueces in vain.

Our body is simly not designed to use these devices.

I want to stress out that this is not a conversation about productivity or something that keeps you behind. The best software engineer I know uses 13 inch MacBook Air and nothing more.
